<h1>SPOTIFY CLONE</h1>

I have developed a Spotify Clone mobile application using React Native, integrating Rapid API to fetch real-time music data. The app allows users to listen to short versions of tracks. Key technologies include React Native, Axios, Lodash, React Navigation, and React Native Track Player, with sound management handled through react-native-sound.
